Hello! My name is Fred Oliveira, and I am a passionate Machine Learning Researcher and Engineer with extensive experience in artificial intelligence and computer science. Over the years, I have had the privilege of working as an assistant professor at the Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT), where I taught courses such as Algorithms and Data Structures, Artificial Intelligence, Object-Oriented Programming, and Software Design and Development. 

In my professional journey, I have worked on cutting-edge projects related to natural language processing and speech processing. My experience extends to developing datasets for multilingual TTS models, as well as creating tools to automate the generation of speech datasets. I have led the development and deployment of AI models for industries such as audiovisual, power transmission, speech processing and music processing. My work combines cutting-edge research with practical applications, aiming to push the boundaries of AI-driven solutions.
